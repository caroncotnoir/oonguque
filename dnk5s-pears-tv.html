So how do you have your menus FilmOn.TV has been a great way to watch live TV from around the world for free. As of May 1, they've switched to a subscription service. While I looked at subscriptions, most of the reviews I've read show the channel as still not working after payment. I used it exclusively to watch live UK TV EDIT: Watching from Canada. Does anyone know of any other Roku channels that offer this? It's really bumming me out that I don't have access to these channels anymore.

So I use channel pear to play live tv from around the world using links (i'm not very technical) through IPTV.the links that work for me in the past are usually m3u8 extensions. I do this to get chinese stations for my wife. I usually just google iptv m3u8 china or cctv to find them. Many don't work, some usually do. But now, none seem to work. I know of a website that plays a ton of chinese live tv called They allow preview of the channels at least. Through Channel Pear you can find web addresses that end in .m3u8 which should be able to play in Channel Pear. However, they keep going down or stop working. Their is one website ( that plays many chinese tv shows live. Is there a way to get the stream on this site to play on channel pear? Sorry, I am not too tech savy and learning http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/feature/a807673/who-is-the-greatest-tv-character-of-the-21st-century-vote-in-our-poll-now/. I installed Channel Pear on my Plex server and I can get the channels I've added to stream through my browser but when I try to load Channel Pear on the Apple TV nothing will play. It just looks like it's trying to load the video for an infinite amount of time. I can see all of the channels just fine. Is it just not updated for the new Apple TV + Plex app yet or are there some changes I may need to make? Thanks. Ok, so I enjoy using channel pear, but really have to trial and error in finding stations. I use it to get live chinese stations. Basically, from what I know, I need msu8 extensions on links and these will work with channel pear. Many times the links don't work, but thats ok. But one station eludes me. Jiang Su TV. Now I can find a website that shows it live streaming: But I can't get this to work with channel pear. I have tried a bunch of msu8.
